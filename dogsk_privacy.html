<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last updated: December 2025</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how this application ("the App") handles user information.
Your privacy is important, and this App is designed to respect it.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>

<p>
The App does <strong>not collect, store, transmit, or share</strong> any personal data.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, the App:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does not require user accounts or registration</li>
  <li>Does not collect names, email addresses, or identifiers</li>
  <li>Does not use analytics or tracking SDKs</li>
  <li>Does not display advertisements</li>
  <li>Does not access contacts, photos, or location</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Browsing Content</h2>

<p>
The App functions as a web browser. All websites you visit are loaded directly from their
respective servers.
</p>

<p>
The App does not monitor, record, or log your browsing activity. Any data processing related
to visited websites is governed by the privacy policies of those websites.
</p>

<h2>3. Local Device Storage</h2>

<p>
The App may store limited data locally on your device, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browser preferences (e.g., selected search engine)</li>
  <li>Temporary cache or browsing state</li>
</ul>

<p>
This data is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is never transmitted externally.
You can clear this data at any time by using the App's features or deleting the App.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
The App does not integrate with third-party services for analytics, advertising, or user
profiling.
</p>

<p>
External websites accessed through the App may collect data according to their own privacy
policies. The App has no control over such data collection.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
Since the App does not collect any personal data, no such information can be stored.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>

<p>
Because the App does not collect or store personal data, there is no risk of personal data
leakage from the App itself.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the App’s functionality changes.
Any updates will be posted on this page.
</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>

<p>
